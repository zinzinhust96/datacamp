* **Bernoulli trial**: an experiment that has two options: "success" (True) and "failure" (False).
* **Random number seed**: `np.random.seed()` for reproducibility
* **Binomial distribution**: The number r of successes in n Bernoulli trials with probability p of success, is `Binomially distributed`
* **Poisson process**: The timing of the next event is completely `independent` of when the previous event happened
* **Poisson distribution**: The number r of arrivals of a Poisson process in a given time interval with average rate of Î» arrivals per interval is `Poisson distributed`.
