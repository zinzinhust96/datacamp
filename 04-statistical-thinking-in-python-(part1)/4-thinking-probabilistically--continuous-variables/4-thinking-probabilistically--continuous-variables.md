* **Continuous variables**: Quantities that can take any value, not just discrete values
* **Probability density function (PDF)**: Mathematical description of the relative likelihood of observing a value of a continuous variable
* **Normal distribution**: Describes a continuous variable whose PDF has a single symmetric peak.
* samples[np.where(samples <= 144)]
* **The Exponential distribution**: The `waiting time` between arrivals of a Poisson process is Exponentially distributed
